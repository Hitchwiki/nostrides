[rideshares.org](https://rideshares.org/) code is at https://github.com/kenflannery/rideshares-nostr


ideas around building [nostr](https://nostr.org/) tools for hitchhiking and ridesharing

* [mediawiki extension]([https://github.com/Hitchwiki/nostrides/issues/2](https://github.com/Trustroots/mediawiki-nostr-auth)) to log in to [hitchwiki](https://hitchwiki.org/) with nostr, using NIP-07
* [thoughts around](https://github.com/kenflannery/rideshares-nostr/issues/3) using nostr to share hitchhiking information on hitchmap and hitchlog

As of Jan 2025 we also have [hitchhiking.org](https://hitchhiking.org/).
